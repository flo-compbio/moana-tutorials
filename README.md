## Overview

This repository contains tutorials for how to use the Moana Python package to cluster and classify scRNA-Seq data by cell type. Currently, the tutorials only cover some basic functionalities, including data preprocessing, clustering, and cell type prediction with an existing classifier. Additional tutorials showing how to construct a new Moana classifier are forthcoming.

The repostitory for the Moana Python package is located at https://github.com/yanailab/moana.
